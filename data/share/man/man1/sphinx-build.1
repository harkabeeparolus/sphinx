.TH "SPHINX-BUILD" "1" "Jul 10, 2024" "7.4.0" "Sphinx"
.SH NAME
sphinx-build \- Sphinx documentation generator tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBsphinx\-build\fP [\fIoptions\fP] <\fIsourcedir\fP> <\fIoutputdir\fP> [\fIfilenames\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBsphinx\-build\fP generates documentation from the files in
\fB<sourcedir>\fP and places it in the \fB<outputdir>\fP\&.
.sp
\fBsphinx\-build\fP looks for \fB<sourcedir>/conf.py\fP for the configuration
settings.  \fBsphinx\-quickstart(1)\fP may be used to generate template
files, including \fBconf.py\fP\&.
.sp
\fBsphinx\-build\fP can create documentation in different formats.  A
format is selected by specifying the builder name on the command line; it
defaults to HTML.  Builders can also perform other tasks related to
documentation processing.  For a list of available builders, refer to
\fI\%Builders\fP\&.
.sp
By default, everything that is outdated is built.  Output only for selected
files can be built by specifying individual filenames.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-M buildername
Select a builder, using the \fImake\-mode\fP\&.
See \fI\%Builders\fP for a list of all of Sphinx\(aqs built\-in builders.
Extensions can add their own builders.
.sp
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Sphinx only recognizes the \fB\-M\fP option if it is used first, along with
the source and output directories, before any other options are passed.
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
sphinx\-build \-M html ./source ./build \-W \-\-keep\-going
.EE

.sp
The \fImake\-mode\fP provides the same build functionality as
a default \fI\%Makefile or Make.bat\fP,
and provides the following additional build pipelines:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fIlatexpdf\fP
Build LaTeX files and run them through \fBpdflatex\fP, or as per
\fI\%latex_engine\fP setting.
If \fI\%language\fP is set to \fB\(aqja\(aq\fP, will use automatically
the \fBplatex/dvipdfmx\fP latex to PDF pipeline.
.TP
.B \fIinfo\fP
Build Texinfo files and run them through \fBmakeinfo\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
The default output directory locations when using \fImake\-mode\fP
differ from the defaults when using \fI\%\-b\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
doctrees are saved to \fB<outputdir>/doctrees\fP
.IP \(bu 2
output files are saved to \fB<outputdir>/<builder name>\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Added in version 1.2.1.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b buildername, \-\-builder buildername
Selects a builder.
.sp
See \fI\%Builders\fP for a list of all of Sphinx\(aqs built\-in builders.
Extensions can add their own builders.
.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-builder\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-write\-all
If given, always write all output files. The default is to only write output
files for new and changed source files. (This may not apply to all
builders.)
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
This option does not re\-read source files.
To read and re\-process every file,
use \fI\%\-\-fresh\-env\fP instead.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-write\-all\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-fresh\-env
Don\(aqt use a saved \fI\%environment\fP (the structure caching all
cross\-references), but rebuild it completely.  The default is to only read
and parse source files that are new or have changed since the last run.
.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-fresh\-env\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-t tag, \-\-tag tag
Define the tag \fItag\fP\&.  This is relevant for \fI\%only\fP directives that
only include their content if this tag is set.
.sp
Added in version 0.6.

.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-tag\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d path, \-\-doctree\-dir path
Since Sphinx has to read and parse all source files before it can write an
output file, the parsed source files are cached as \(dqdoctree pickles\(dq.
Normally, these files are put in a directory called \fB\&.doctrees\fP under
the build directory; with this option you can select a different cache
directory (the doctrees can be shared between all builders).
.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-doctree\-dir\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-j N, \-\-jobs N
Distribute the build over \fIN\fP processes in parallel, to make building on
multiprocessor machines more effective.  Note that not all parts and not all
builders of Sphinx can be parallelized.  If \fBauto\fP argument is given,
Sphinx uses the number of CPUs as \fIN\fP\&. Defaults to 1.
.sp
Added in version 1.2: This option should be considered \fIexperimental\fP\&.

.sp
Changed in version 1.7: Support \fBauto\fP argument.

.sp
Changed in version 6.2: Add \fB\-\-jobs\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c path, \-\-config\-dir path
Don\(aqt look for the \fBconf.py\fP in the source directory, but use the given
configuration directory instead.  Note that various other files and paths
given by configuration values are expected to be relative to the
configuration directory, so they will have to be present at this location
too.
.sp
Added in version 0.3.

.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-config\-dir\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-isolated
Don\(aqt look for a configuration file; only take options via the \fI\%\-\-define\fP option.
.sp
Added in version 0.5.

.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-isolated\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-D setting=value, \-\-define setting=value
Override a configuration value set in the \fBconf.py\fP file.  The value
must be a number, string, list or dictionary value.
.sp
For lists, you can separate elements with a comma like this: \fB\-D
html_theme_path=path1,path2\fP\&.
.sp
For dictionary values, supply the setting name and key like this:
\fB\-D latex_elements.docclass=scrartcl\fP\&.
.sp
For boolean values, use \fB0\fP or \fB1\fP as the value.
.sp
Changed in version 0.6: The value can now be a dictionary value.

.sp
Changed in version 1.3: The value can now also be a list value.

.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-define\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-A name=value, \-\-html\-define name=value
Make the \fIname\fP assigned to \fIvalue\fP in the HTML templates.
.sp
Added in version 0.5.

.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-html\-define\fP long option.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nitpicky
Run in nit\-picky mode.  Currently, this generates warnings for all missing
references.  See the config value \fI\%nitpick_ignore\fP for a way to
exclude some references as \(dqknown missing\(dq.
.sp
Changed in version 7.3: Add \fB\-\-nitpicky\fP long option.

(and their dependencies).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
The \fBsphinx\-build\fP refers following environment variables:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B MAKE
A path to make command.  A command name is also allowed.
\fBsphinx\-build\fP uses it to invoke sub\-build process on make\-mode.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Makefile Options
.sp
The \fBMakefile\fP and \fBmake.bat\fP files created by
\fBsphinx\-quickstart\fP usually run \fBsphinx\-build\fP only with the
\fI\%\-b\fP and \fI\%\-d\fP options.  However, they support the following
variables to customize behavior:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B PAPER
This sets the \fB\(aqpapersize\(aq\fP key of \fI\%latex_elements\fP:
i.e. \fBPAPER=a4\fP sets it to \fB\(aqa4paper\(aq\fP and \fBPAPER=letter\fP to
\fB\(aqletterpaper\(aq\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Usage of this environment variable got broken at Sphinx 1.5 as
\fBa4\fP or \fBletter\fP ended up as option to LaTeX document in
place of the needed \fBa4paper\fP, resp. \fBletterpaper\fP\&.  Fixed at
1.7.7.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
